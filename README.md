# Experience xAPI Vocabulary Primer

This Primer is an introductory document designed to complement the [Companion Specification for xAPI Vocabularies](https://adl.gitbooks.io/companion-specification-for-xapi-vocabularies/content/) by providing the reader with additional knowledge and examples. It is more precise about how to use the terms than the Companion Specification. It also covers some introductory real-world examples of what can be immediately achieved by publishing xAPI vocabularies as Linked Data (LD). The reader is presented with a descriptive narrative of classes and properties that are most commonly used for representing [xAPI vocabularies as linked datasets](https://adl.gitbooks.io/companion-specification-for-xapi-vocabularies/content/xapi_vocabularies_as_linked_datasets.html).
